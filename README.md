# Bandon FEWS Small Data Scraper in Node.js
## Introduction
Cork County Council has a site called [Bandon FEWS](http://www.bandonfloodwarning.ie/) (Bandon Flood Early Warning System). When the Bandon river hits certain levels near Bandon town, it alerts registered users via SMS in case they need to take emergency measures. It's a very useful service. However the historical river level data is not available in any useful form and that's the point of this project.

In November 2011, I created a simple Python script which scrapes the site every 15 minutes and saves the river level to a Google Fusions Table "spreadsheet" [here](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=103YIcARoxuaWT7NfZ8mVBzY554sF_3ONYC1N3DE#rows:id=1). This now has (with a few interruptions) a lot of data which anyone can query, re-use or slice-dice and mashup with weather info. Not that anyone has done this :-)

I re-wrote it in Node.js in 2014.

To use it for something else on Fusion Tables, the main thing you need to do is setup an App in the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project?authuser=0), enable Fusion Tables API access and use those keys in the placeholders in the config files.

## Files
* main.js - The main code
* bandonfews.conf - Supervisor config file. Copy to /etc/supervisor/conf.d/bandonfews.conf then `sudo supervisorctl reread` and `sudo supervisorctl reread`
* tokens-example.json - rename to tokens.json. Will be auto-generated by the code on first run in any case
* config-example.json - Rename to config.json and fill out the Google OAuth API key/secret, the URL of the FEWS site and the id of the Fusion Table
* index.html - Placeholder for upcoming landing page
* server.js - Placeholder for upcoming API server
* package.json - Required Node.js packages. `npm install` to install everything
* .gitignore - Stuff that shouldn't go under Git control

## TO-DO
* The first time run is currently broken for the OAuth credentials.
* Token refresh is not handled yet but has never been required.
* It should have a simple Express based API so others can avoid the pain of dealing with the Fusion Tables API for basic queries
* It should have a simple landing page showing the latest water level and maybe a graph

## Changelog
* 04/01/2015 - First public usable version and [blogpost](http://conoroneill.net/bandon-flood-warning-data-now-scraped-to-google-fusion-tables-using-nodejs)
* 05/01/2015 - Add error handling for parsing issues in case FEWS site changes and breaks the scraping
